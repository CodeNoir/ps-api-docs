            "description": "<p>Possibly the largest penthouse louvre in the world! A Colt Universal 3UL Triple Bank Louvre System 10x10mx10m, takes pride of place on top of one of the most ground breaking buildings in New Zealand.  <br>In an effort to reduce ASB\u2019s carbon footprint by 20%, and set new standards for environmental quality and energy performance, ASB has taken full advantage of some of the latest sustainable systems and building technologies. <br>This is Australasia\u2019s first fixed-bin, displacement, mixed mode ventilation system.  This complex ventilation system utilizes thermal mass and the Venturi effect to extract heat from the building and exhaust it through the internal funnel like atria and out via Colt\u2019s chimney-like penthouse louvre.  <br>The Colt triple bank louvres are used to protect the actuated dampers located in behind which open depending on wind direction, effectively \u2018dragging\u2019 heat load from the building. This passive ventilation system is then controlled by an internal computer system.  <br>Colt\u2019s 3UL/DH louvre system was specified for maximum rain defence, aerodynamics and guaranteed performance tested in accordance with AS/NZS 4740:2000.<br>Colt Products and Systems were contracted to design, manufacture and install the high performance weather louvre system with a BMS actuated damper structure behind and all of the secondary structural steel for the cube. National Manager for Colt Products and Systems, Andy Oakley says \u201cOur engineers were instrumental with the design and construction methodology of the cube at a very early stage\u201d.   <br>Internationally, Colt is a front runner in sustainable technology. Colt develops technologies that harness the natural elements to make the most efficient use of energy, and contribute to a sustainable built environment.</p>",
